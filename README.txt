# Example file for working with Calendars
#
#import the calendar module
#create a plain text calendar
#create an HTML formatted calendar
#loop over the days of a month
#zeroes mean that the day of the week is in an overlapping month 
#The Calendar module provides useful utilities for the given locale,
#such as the names of days and months in both full and abbreviated forms
#Calculate days based on a rule: For example, consider
# a team meeting on the first Friday of every month.
# To figure out what days that would be for each month,

# Example file for working with conditional statements
# conditional flow uses if, elif, else
# conditional statements let you use "a if C else b"
# match-case makes it easy to compare multiple values

# Example file for working with date information
# Get today's date from the simple today() method from the date class
# Print out the date's individual components
# Retrieve today's weekday (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
## DATETIME OBJECTS
# Get today's date from the datetime class
# Get the current time

# Example file for working with classes
# Errors can happen in programs, and we need a clean way to handle them
# This code will cause an error because you can't divide by zero:
# Exceptions provide a way of catching errors and then handling them in 
# a separate section of the code to group them together
# catch specific exceptions

# Read and write files using the built-in Python file methods
# Open a file for writing and create it if it doesn't exist
# Open the file for appending text to the end
# write some lines of data to the file
# close the file when done
# Open the file back up and read the contents

#
# Example file for formatting time and date output
# Times and dates can be formatted using a set of predefined string
# control codes 
#### Date Formatting ####
# %y/%Y - Year, %a/%A - weekday, %b/%B - month, %d - day of month
# %c - locale's date and time, %x - locale's date, %X - locale's time
#### Time Formatting ####
# %I/%H - 12/24 Hour, %M - minute, %S - second, %p - locale's AM/PM

# Example file for parsing and processing JSON
# Use the json module to load the string data into a dictionary
# now we can access the contents of the JSON like any other Python object
# output the number of events, plus the magnitude and each event name  
# for each event, print the place where it occurred
# print the events that only have a magnitude greater than 4
# print only the events where at least 1 person reported feeling something
# define a variable to hold the source URL
# In this case we'll use the free data feed from the USGS
# This feed lists all earthquakes for the last day larger than Mag 2.5
# Open the URL and read the data

# import the math module, which contains features for working with mathematics
# the math module contains lots of pre-built functions
# in addition to functions, some modules contain useful constants

# Example file for working with os.path module
# Print the name of the OS
# Check for item existence and type
# Work with file paths
# Get the modification time
# Calculate how long ago the item was modified

# Example file for working with timedelta objects
# construct a basic timedelta and print it
# print today's date
# print today's date one year from now
# create a timedelta that uses more than one argument
# calculate the date 1 week ago, formatted as a string
### How many days until April Fools' Day?
# use date comparison to see if April Fool's has already gone for this year
# if it has, use the replace() function to get the date for next year
# Now calculate the amount of time until April Fool's Day

# Example file for variables
# Basic data types in Python: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Sequences, Dictionaries
# print(myint)
# print(myfloat)
# print(mystr)
# print(mybool)
# print(mylist)
# print(mytuple)
# print(mydict)
# re-declaring a variable works
# myint = "abc"
# print(myint)
# to access a member of a sequence type, use []
# print(mylist[2])
# print(mytuple[1])     
# use slices to get parts of a sequence
# print(mylist[1:5])
# print(mylist[1:5:2])
# you can use slices to reverse a sequence
